                        We came into 2020 really excited about the Animal Sanctuary coming up in Kolad. We had made
                        great

                        early in the

                    We’ve been very lucky to have had landlords who have endorsed and supported our vision over the last
                    ten
                    years.
                    However, we’ve felt for a while that it’s time to own and manage our own place. We’re happy to
                    announce that
                    we’ve identified a plot of land not far from our current Rehab Centre in Malad, Mumbai. We’re

                    <h3><b><u>Why?</u></b></h3>
                    We are building on everything that we’ve learnt and done in the last ten years so we can continue

                    for
                    the next ten years. This includes expanding our infrastructure, training and certifying the next
                    generation
                    of
                    animal caregivers, facilitating a learning centre for animal lovers, expanding our team and above
                    all
                    continuing
                    to provide the best care for animals in need.<br><br>

                    We require your support to make this dream of ours a reality so that we can continue supporting the
                    animals
                    in
                    need. As always, we need support from as many people as we can get, so I’d request you to share this

                        India is one of the largest and fastest-growing economies in the world. On one hand, when we are
                        making
                        such
                        economic advancements there is still a section that is deprived of basic needs. According to a
                        report by
                        UNDP,
                        India has lifted 271 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016. The improved assets in
                        the
                        country
                        include cooking fuel, sanitation, and nutrition for the poor. But is it enough?<br><BR>

                    <h3><b><u>Children and Poverty</u></b></h3>
                    Millions of children in India are still involved in daily wage-earning, poor children are not
                    educated. They
                    do
                    not receive proper nutrition. 373 million Indians still continue to experience acute deprivations.
                    Most of
                    these
                    deprived populations are children, the future of the country. A joint report released by UNICEF and
                    International Labor Organization in 2019 stated that 30.3 percent of extremely poor children live in
                    India.
                    The
                    nation has been successful in reducing cases in the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) but the
                    core issues
                    remain the same. Education for poor children, reducing drop-outs from schools, food security, and
                    child
                    mortality are the burning issues that the country is currently facing.<br><BR>

                    <h3><b><u>Illiteracy in India</u></b></h3>
                    The Right to Education Act 0f 2009 has been instrumental in reducing the number of out-of-school
                    children in
                    India. Yet, there are 6 million children still out of school in India. The Covid-19 pandemic induced
                    economic
                    insecurities have led to an addition in the number of Out of School Children. A number of children
                    have
                    started
                    helping parents with household chores, daily wage-earning, or taking care of younger siblings. The
                    pandemic
                    has
                    made the situations of girls more vulnerable. Spending more time at home leads to an increase in
                    their
                    involvement in household activities and in many cases they also fall victims to child
                    marriage.<br><BR>

                    <h3><b><u>Dropouts,and Problems with the Indian Education System</u></b></h3>
                    A recent ASER Report has stated that many young children have not joined school after the reopening
                    and
                    there is
                    a sharp jump in out-of-school children in the 6-10 age groups. This has gone up from 1.8% (in 2018)
                    to 5.3%
                    (in
                    2020) and among all children up to 16 years from 4% to 5.5%. One primary reason for this may be the
                    financial
                    constraints parents are facing due to the pandemic.<br><BR>

                    School-going children also often face the problem of poor learning levels. This obstacle in learning
                    is the
                    outcome of the absence of a strong foundation. This foundation is usually provided by quality early
                    childhood
                    education. Another problem is the lack of qualified teachers and the absence of quality teacher
                    training.<br><BR>

                    <h3<b><u>Smile Foundation Interventions</u></b></h3>
                    Smile Foundation’s Mission Education program works for the education of poor children in urban slums
                    and
                    rural
                    areas. Since 2002, more than 232,000 children have been directly benefitted through the program.
                    Smile
                    Foundation’s educational initiatives include Pre-school [3-6 yrs], Non-Formal Education [6-14 yrs
                    non-school
                    going], Remedial Education [6-14 yrs school going], and Bridge Course [14-18 yrs drop-outs].
                    Nutritious food
                    is
                    provided in the Mission education centers for children to encourage them to attend school.<br><BR>

                    During the pandemic teachers from Mission Education ensured that no child was left behind in their
                    studies.
                    Classes were conducted online for children. For the poor children who did not have access to digital
                    devices,
                    teachers delivered notes. Cluster classes were conducted once the lockdown was eased. Teachers’
                    training and
                    counseling sessions for parents were also conducted.<br><BR>

                    The key to development lies in educating children. Partnerships between the government and other
                    stakeholders
                    can fast-track the process of education for poor children. Improving access to education, counseling
                    of
                    students
                    and parents, innovations in classroom teaching and learning process can aid the condition of
                    education in
                    India.<br><BR>

                        Sounds of Silence is one of the best NGO’s in Mumbai and Delhi for the hearing-impaired. It
                        started off
                        as a
                        social internship program by the founder, Mr Sumit Singh Gandhi. He met a deaf and mute person
                        at the
                        NGO and
                        was unable to communicate with him. This led to hour long conversations of exchanging
                        handwritten text.
                        As a
                        pilot project, ten children in Punjab were taught to communicate via SMS. Its success continues
                        to this
                        day when
                        the children can send 100 SMS everyday with a 25% increase in IQ.<br><br>

                        ‘BitGiving’ is an idea which utilises donated cellphones and money to fund education for the
                        deaf
                        children.
                        SOS’s motto is ‘Deafness with Dignity and Equality’. Their mission is to achieve equal access
                        for deaf
                        people to
                        all departments of life.<br><br>

                        Sounds of Silence has received prestigious awards such as the World Education Summit Award and
                        Social
                        Entrepreneurship Award. SOS is the first NGO of its kind using technology to empower the
                        hearing-impaired.<br><br>

                        All of these NGO’s have and continue to scale pinnacles in their respective work. It’s
                        overwhelming to
                        see the
                        change that NGO’s are bringing about in the lives of people in our country.

                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Education for Poor Children</h2>
                    <p>
                        India is one of the largest and fastest-growing economies in the world. On one hand, when we are
                        making
                        such
                        economic advancements there is still a section that is deprived of basic needs. According to a
                        report by
                        UNDP,
                        India has lifted 271 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016. The improved assets in
                        the
                        country
                        include cooking fuel, sanitation, and nutrition for the poor. But is it enough?<br><BR>

                    <h3>Children and Poverty</h3>
                    Millions of children in India are still involved in daily wage-earning, poor children are not
                    educated. They
                    do
                    not receive proper nutrition. 373 million Indians still continue to experience acute deprivations.
                    Most of
                    these
                    deprived populations are children, the future of the country. A joint report released by UNICEF and
                    International Labor Organization in 2019 stated that 30.3 percent of extremely poor children live in
                    India.
                    The
                    nation has been successful in reducing cases in the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) but the
                    core issues
                    remain the same. Education for poor children, reducing drop-outs from schools, food security, and
                    child
                    mortality are the burning issues that the country is currently facing.<br><BR>

                    <h3>Illiteracy in India</h3>
                    The Right to Education Act 0f 2009 has been instrumental in reducing the number of out-of-school
                    children in
                    India. Yet, there are 6 million children still out of school in India. The Covid-19 pandemic induced
                    economic
                    insecurities have led to an addition in the number of Out of School Children. A number of children
                    have
                    started
                    helping parents with household chores, daily wage-earning, or taking care of younger siblings. The
                    pandemic
                    has
                    made the situations of girls more vulnerable. Spending more time at home leads to an increase in
                    their
                    involvement in household activities and in many cases they also fall victims to child
                    marriage.<br><BR>

                    <h3>Drop-outs, and Problems in Education System</h3>
                    A recent ASER Report has stated that many young children have not joined school after the reopening
                    and
                    there is
                    a sharp jump in out-of-school children in the 6-10 age groups. This has gone up from 1.8% (in 2018)
                    to 5.3%
                    (in
                    2020) and among all children up to 16 years from 4% to 5.5%. One primary reason for this may be the
                    financial
                    constraints parents are facing due to the pandemic.<br><BR>

                    School-going children also often face the problem of poor learning levels. This obstacle in learning
                    is the
                    outcome of the absence of a strong foundation. This foundation is usually provided by quality early
                    childhood
                    education. Another problem is the lack of qualified teachers and the absence of quality teacher
                    training.<br><BR>

                    <h3>Smile Foundation Interventions</h3>
                    Smile Foundation’s Mission Education program works for the education of poor children in urban slums
                    and
                    rural
                    areas. Since 2002, more than 232,000 children have been directly benefitted through the program.
                    Smile
                    Foundation’s educational initiatives include Pre-school [3-6 yrs], Non-Formal Education [6-14 yrs
                    non-school
                    going], Remedial Education [6-14 yrs school going], and Bridge Course [14-18 yrs drop-outs].
                    Nutritious food
                    is
                    provided in the Mission education centers for children to encourage them to attend school.<br><BR>

                    During the pandemic teachers from Mission Education ensured that no child was left behind in their
                    studies.
                    Classes were conducted online for children. For the poor children who did not have access to digital
                    devices,
                    teachers delivered notes. Cluster classes were conducted once the lockdown was eased. Teachers’
                    training and
                    counseling sessions for parents were also conducted.<br><BR>

                    The key to development lies in educating children. Partnerships between the government and other
                    stakeholders
                    can fast-track the process of education for poor children. Improving access to education, counseling
                    of
                    students
                    and parents, innovations in classroom teaching and learning process can aid the condition of
                    education in
                    India.<br><BR>

                        Sounds of Silence is one of the best NGO’s in Mumbai and Delhi for the hearing-impaired. It
                        started off
                        as a
                        social internship program by the founder, Mr Sumit Singh Gandhi. He met a deaf and mute person
                        at the
                        NGO and
                        was unable to communicate with him. This led to hour long conversations of exchanging
                        handwritten text.
                        As a
                        pilot project, ten children in Punjab were taught to communicate via SMS. Its success continues
                        to this
                        day when
                        the children can send 100 SMS everyday with a 25% increase in IQ.<br><br>

                        ‘BitGiving’ is an idea which utilises donated cellphones and money to fund education for the
                        deaf
                        children.
                        SOS’s motto is ‘Deafness with Dignity and Equality’. Their mission is to achieve equal access
                        for deaf
                        people to
                        all departments of life.<br><br>

                        Sounds of Silence has received prestigious awards such as the World Education Summit Award and
                        Social
                        Entrepreneurship Award. SOS is the first NGO of its kind using technology to empower the
                        hearing-impaired.<br><br>

                        All of these NGO’s have and continue to scale pinnacles in their respective work. It’s
                        overwhelming to
                        see the
                        change that NGO’s are bringing about in the lives of people in our country.
